# Frontend Coding Challenge

## Setup

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

###  Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn
# run dev-server
yarn dev
# open http://localhost:3000 to see the result
```

## Task context
This project represents an (overly simplified) application that implements the insurance buying flow (further referred to as ‚Äúbuyflow‚Äù). A buyflow is a sequence of steps arranged in a specific order. Each step collects some data from a user that is later presented for confirmation in the summary step. In a real-life project this would be followed by the checkout and purchase process, but these parts are excluded from this project for the sake of simplicity.

## Assignment
Add a new flow next to the existing developer insurance buyflow for a ‚Äúdesigner insurance‚Äù. The flow should have the same steps as the dev insurance but with 1 additional step to collect the customer‚Äôs first and last name and display them in the summary step. Make sure it is not possible to proceed to the next step if the required field data is missing.

## Some things to keep in mind
- The code of the provided application is not final and is **intentionally** left not ideal. That means that it is **expected** of you to change it if you believe it improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability or if you believe the code deviates from the industry standards or best practices.
- Treat this like a production app and assume that once you‚Äôre done with this feature, more features will be added to it by you and your coworkers. That means check the details of what you‚Äôre doing and how it should fit into the codebase.
- The scope of this task is purely functional. UI and UX aspects are not important.
- You shouldn‚Äôt need to add additional package dependencies to complete the task, but you can if you want.
- Try to keep your commits history well organised and clean, like you would do in a pull request for a real task assignment.
- You can take as long as you want, but most candidates spend between 2 and 6 hours on the task.

## Above all: have fun!‚úåüèª
